Any users that do not exist will be skipped automatically.

## Airdrop file

**airdrop.txt**:  

frank, 1000  
ned, 1000

Make a copy of config.json.example to config.json and the edit file.

In the configuration file you need to set the following information:

* account_name - Account you will distribute tokens from
* wif - Active key for this account
* token - Name of the Steem Engine Token to airdrop
* memo - Memo to airdrop recipients
* mode - This can either be transfer, issue, stake
* delay - delay between users, recommended at least 10 seconds
* dry_run - True/False if you want to just do a test run

Once everything is set up, just need to do `python go.py <airdrop filename>` to start.

If you found this tool useful, send whatever you think this tool is worth to you in any token to @themarkymark.
